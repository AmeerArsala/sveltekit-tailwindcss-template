# SvelteKit + TailwindCSS starter template

This is simply just a SvelteKit + TailwindCSS template with support for markdown (mdSveX), pnpm, axios, prettier, eslint, support for TypeScript, and uses Vite as the build tool. Also includes the VSCode extensions that help with it.

It is bare bones and great for building web apps as fast as possible.
